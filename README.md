# DevOps App

This is an application Vivien and Clemence created. It is a basic NodeJS web application exposing REST API that creates and stores user parameters in [Redis database](https://redis.io/). To make the application more interesting, we decided to build it as a compagny's chart: see the employees of each department and decide to dismiss or upgrade them. Also, it is possible to add an employee to any department.

## Usage

### Initialization

In init file, we initialized three departments with employees. To init :
```bash
$ cd backend 
$ node src/init
```

### Starting

Start the web application:

```bash
$ cd backend 
$ npm start
```
```bash
$ cd frontend 
$ npm start
```
## Testing

From the root directory of the project, run:

```
npm test
```

## Fonctionalities

### Web application

We implemented a web application that allows a Human Resources Manager, for example, to see his/her compagny's chart: get the employees of each department and decide to dismiss or upgrade them. Also, it is possible to add an employee to any department. 

* Our application ensures CRUD user funtionality.
* We used Redis to store information. 
* We coded some tests for the connection, creation and listing of employees...

### CI/CD pipeline

We configured and applied CI/CD pipeline using the platforms Travis CI and Heroku. Links : 
* Travis CI: https://travis-ci.com/github/VivienECE/devops-project
* Heroku: VIVIEN

### IaC approach

We used Vagrant to configure and provision a virtual environment. And provision our VM with Ansible Provisioner to install and run:
* Nodejs
* Redis
* Our application (with sync folders)
* Health check of our application

### Docker image

We created a Docker image of our application and pushed it to Docker Hub. Link : https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vivienece/backend

### Docker Compose

We created a ``` docker-compose.yml``` file that starts our application.

### Kurbernetes

Using Minikube, we installed Kubernetes and created yaml files:
* deployments
* services
* persistent volume and persistent volume claim

### Istio

We made a service mesh using Istio by creating configuration of:
* route requests between 2 different versions of our app
* traffic shifting between 2 different versions of our app

### Bonus

* We made more different API methods (see /backend).
* We made more different unit/functional/integration tests (see /backend).
